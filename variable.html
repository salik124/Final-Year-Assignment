<h1>The Intro</h1>
<p>var: This is the traditional way to declare a variable. Variables declared with var are function-scoped, meaning they are only available within the function where they are defined, or globally if declared outside a function. var is also hoisted, meaning it is moved to the top of its scope during compilation.</p>
